# socket-example

This is trying to TCP socket networking by Golang. Ref to https://astaxie.gitbooks.io/build-web-application-with-golang/ja/08.1.html

I build TCP Client and Server.

## how to try

```
// run server
% cd server
% go run server.go

// request to server
% cd client
% go run client.go 127.0.0.1:8000
```
